# Simple-Website_Analyser-Script
This script uses the requests library to download the HTML content of the website, and then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract the elements with the price class. 
It then converts the text from each element to a float and uses the pandas library to create a DataFrame and calculate some basic statistics about the prices. 
Finally, it prints the results, such as the mean, max, and min prices.
You can modify this script to suit your needs, such as extracting different elements from the website or calculating more advanced statistics about the prices. 
You could also save the results to a file or use them for further processing.
